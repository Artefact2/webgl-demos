		<p>I find oldschool demos fascinating. I want to recreate some
			of the most interesting effects using WebGL. One of my
			long term goals is to eventually produce my own demo.</p>
		<p>Watch these lame attempts at me trying to dabble in core
			OpenGL/WebGL concepts to recreate famous demo effects.</p>
		<p>Some useful
			links: <a href='https://github.com/Artefact2/webgl-demos/'>source
			code</a> and my <a href='https://artefact2.com/'>personal
			website</a>.</p>

				<h6><a href='./panic.html'><img src='./img/panic.png' alt='' /><span>Panic!</span></a></h6>
				<p>My attempt to
				recreate <a href='https://youtu.be/dh6N3QylX0s?list=LLIwnq09cDSoBJwHkXs9ueuQ&t=138'>this
				scene</a> from "Panic" by Future Crew
				(<a href='http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=479'>pouet</a>).</p>
				<p>Who would have thought something as simple as
				trails would require off-screen rendering? So yeah, in
				this demo I deal with framebuffers, textures and,
				surprisingly for the first time, multiple shader
				programs.</p>

				<h6><a href='./platonic.html'><img src='./img/platonic.png' alt='' /><span>Platonic Solids</span></a></h6>
				<p>I finally got around to implement the ubiquitous
					primitives found in every good demo. Doing the
					math was the most annoying thing, so was inputting
					everything by hand in the right order.</p>
				<p>First time I had to really deal with lighting,
					normals, face culling, etc. Interesting stuff. I
					also have numbered the faces so I can do per-face
					color/texture.</p>
				<p>Fun fact: the goal was, originally, to
					recreate <a href='https://youtu.be/rFv7mHTf0nA?t=129'>this
					scene</a> from "Second reality" by Future Crew
					(<a href='http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=63'>pouet</a>). I
					decided to implement all the primitives for the
					five solids, only to realise after the fact the
					spinning solid in this scene isn't even one of
					them. I think it is
					a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrakis_hexahedron'>tetrakis
					hexahedron</a>, but I am not sure.</p>

				<h6><a href='./uvsphere.html'><img src='./img/uvsphere.png' alt='' /><span>UV Sphere</span></a></h6>
				<p>Not exactly sure where I got the inspiration for
					this monstrosity. Anyway, I finally got around to
					add proper slider so you can tweak with some
					values in real time (including geometry).</p>

				<h6><a href='./scroller.html'><img src='./img/scroller.png' alt='' /><span>Scroller (Interject)</span></a></h6>
				<p>Have you ever been "interjected for a moment" with
					style? This demo was challenging for a couple of
					reasons. I had to create a bitmap font, embed it
					in the source code then dynamically generate the
					text geometry at runtime. The text also loops.</p>

				<h6><a href='./cube-points.html'><img src='./img/cube-points.png' alt='' /><span>RGB Cube</span></a></h6>
				<p>I got inspired
					by <a href='https://youtu.be/gKNvLyxHTmg?t=64'>this</a>
					scene of "Pirates of the 777 seas", by Razor 1911
					(<a href='http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=56549'>pouet</a>). I
					liked the Moir√©-like patterns as the cube rotates,
					so I left it as is.</p>

				<h6><a href='./tvnoise.html'><img src='./img/tvnoise.png' alt='' /><span>TV Noise</span></a></h6>
				<p>It's white noise. What else were you expecting? May
					come in handy if your LCD panel has dead
					pixels.</p>

				<h6><a href='./overdrive.html'><img src='./img/overdrive.png' alt='' /><span>Overdrive</span></a></h6>
				<p>Original inspiration came from
					the <a href='https://youtu.be/sQNcIKAIBF0?t=240'>Overdrive</a>
					demo by Titan
					(<a href='http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61724'>pouet</a>). As
					I tried to recreate this scene it eventually
					evolved in something else.</p>

				<h6><a href='./cube-fog.html'><img src='./img/cube-fog.png' alt='' /><span>Fogged Cube</span></a></h6>
				<p>My very first demo. The goal was to do recreate
					something
					like <a href='https://youtu.be/0CBQI7cktMk?t=68'>this
					scene</a> of "We have accidentally borrowed your
					votedisk" by Razor1911
					(<a href='http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=56871'>pouet</a>). However
					after realising the amount of work needed I was
					very happy to have anything rendered at all.</p>
				<p>Skip this one, it's really boring.</p>
